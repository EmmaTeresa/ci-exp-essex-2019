@techreport{aufenanger18,
	Abstract = {Methods of systematically balanced treatment allocation for economic experiments, as an alternative to random allocation, are gaining increasing attention in recent years. This paper analyzes the benefits and the limits of a systematic allocation of treatments within a linear model framework. Linear models do not necessarily require the treatment allocation to be random. Since the variance of the treatment estimator within linear models does not depend on the realization of the dependent variable, whenever the covariate information is available prior to allocating treatments it is possible to allocate treatments in a way that minimizes the variance of the treatment estimator. I show that in each experiment satisfying the linear model assumptions, there exists at least one deterministic optimal design, i.e., a deterministic way of allocating treatments that minimizes the variance of the treatment estimator over all alternative ways of allocating treatments. In finite samples, optimal design reduces the variance of the treatment estimator and increases statistical power compared to random allocation. For a given linear model with m covariates, optimal design reduces the required sample size of the experiment to achieve a predefined power by approximately m. However, asymptotically, as the sample size goes to infinity, neither optimal design nor any alternative design yields any benefit over random allocation.},

	Abstract = {The literature on teaching and learning heralds the benefits of discussion for student learner outcomes, especially its ability to improve students' critical thinking skills. Yet, few studies compare the effects of different types of face-to-face discussions on learners. Using student surveys, we analyze the benefits of small-group and large-class discussions in an upper-level political theory course. We also analyze whether the same types of students are likely to participate and reap the benefits of both types of discussions. We find that, overall, participation is higher in small-group discussions, as are students' perceptions of learner outcomes. We also find a more equal participation of students of different ethnic backgrounds in small-group discussions; similarly, previous academic achievements have less influence on discussion participation in small groups.},

	Abstract = {Both Black and White voter turnout increases 2--3 percentage points with each Black Democrat on the ballot. Given the groups' representations in the population, the White response is numerically greater. Whites of both parties are less likely to vote for their parties' candidate when s/he is Black. The turnout findings are not explained away by voter, election, or politician characteristics. However, the fact that there is no turnout response to Black Republicans suggests that a perception of Blacks' ideology may be a factor.},

	Abstract = {Social Scientists rarely take full advantage of the information available in their statistical results. As a consequence, they miss opportunities to present quantities that are of greatest substantive interest for their research and express the appropriate degree of certainty about these quantities. In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently overlooked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors{\textquoteright} own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use Clarify software that implements our suggestions.},

	both matched sampling and regression adjustment can be expected to
	reduce bias, (2) in some cases when the variance of the matching
	variable differs in the two populations both matching and regression
	adjustment can increase bias, (3) when the variance of the matching
	variable is the same in the two populations and the distributions
	of the matching variable are symmetric the usual covariance adjusted
	estimate based on random samples is almost unbiased, and (4) the

	get-out-the-vote contact via phone, mail, or canvassing. These individuals
	are randomly selected from voter rolls in New Haven, CT. That is,
	this article includes a random sample, randomly assigned to treatment.
	Thus, causal inferences can be drawn from this study, and extrapolated
	to the larger population of registered voters in New Haven. In their
	conclusions, the authors compare their study to studies of other
	localities, without reference to differences or similarities across
	towns. It seems that the implied conclusion of the article is that
	the findings are applicable to all registered voters in the \emph{entire}
	United States. Since the original sample frame includes only voters
	in New Haven, a non-randomly selected town, the article's broadest
	implications appear to be over-reaching. The authors find that canvassing
	strongly increases turnout, mail weakly increases turnout, and phone
	calls do not affect turnout. Methodologically, the authors divide
	the treatment-minus-control effect estimate by the contact [compliance]
	rate to estimate causal effect. Two-stage OLS and two-stage probit
	estimates are employed, using assignment to contact as an instrument.},

	Abstract = {Quite often, policy changes that are seen as welfare-improving at the national level encounter significant resistance in localities where the policies are implemented.  Defense spending cuts and international trade agreements are classic examples.  However, there is little systematic evidence on the magnitude of economic costs that fall on adversely affected communities.  In this paper, we use a newly constructed dataset to analyze the county-level employment and personal income effects resulting from closures of military bases during 1971 - 1994.  Our estimated multipliers are mostly less than one, and considerably smaller than those typically used in economic impact studies.  We find that the employment costs are mostly limited to the direct job loss associated with military transfers out of the region, and per-capita income is little affected by closures on average.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the present value of state employee pension liabilities as of June 2009 using discount rates that reflect the risk of the payments from a taxpayer perspective. If benefits have the same default and recovery characteristics as state general obligation debt, the national total of promised liabilities based on current salary and service is $3.20 trillion. If pensions have higher priority than state debt, the present value of liabilities is much larger. Using zero-coupon Treasury yields, which are default-free but contain other priced risks, promised liabilities are $4.43 trillion. Liabilities are even larger under broader concepts that account for projected salary growth and future service. },

	control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate
	that following Proposition 99 tobacco consumption fell markedly in
	California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We
	estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales
	in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have
	been in the absence of Proposition 99. Given that many policy interventions
	and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate
	level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number
	of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control
	methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in
	situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.
	The methods proposed in this article produce informative inference
	regardless of the number of available comparison units, the number
	of available time periods, and whether the data are individual (micro)
	or aggregate (macro). Software to compute the estimators proposed
	in this article is available at the authors' web-pages.},

We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

@article{barfrahil03,
	Abstract = {The precarious state of the educational system in the inner cities of the United States, as well as its potential causes and solutions, have been popular topics of debate in recent years. Part of the difficulty in resolving this debate is the lack of solid empirical evidence regarding the true impact of educational initiatives. The efficacy of so-called "school choice" programs has been a particularly contentious issue. A current multimillion dollar program, the School Choice Scholarship Foundation Program in New York, randomized the distribution of vouchers in an attempt to shed some light on this issue. This is an important time for school choice, because on June 27, 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a voucher program in Cleveland that provides scholarships both to secular and religious private schools. Although this study benefits immensely from a randomized design, it suffers from complications common to such research with human subjects: noncompliance with assigned "treatments" and missing data. Recent work has revealed threats to valid estimates of experimental effects that exist in the presence of noncompliance and missing data, even when the goal is to estimate simple intention-to-treat effects. Our goal was to create a better solution when faced with both noncompliance and missing data. This article presents a model that accommodates these complications that is based on the general framework of "principal stratification" and thus relies on more plausible assumptions than standard methodology. Our analyses revealed positive effects on math scores for children who applied to the program from certain types of schools-those with average test scores below the citywide median. Among these children, the effects are stronger for children who applied in the first grade and for African-American children. },

Else, if labor is weakly organized, center/right parties adopt majoritarian institutions to keep left out.  PR comes about as a cross-class alliance from common interests in co-specific skills.  PR is minimal/exclusive w.r.t. redistribution, inclusive w.r.t. skills development/regulation.  CIS Key: move beyond just redistribution as outcome, to "regulatory/skills development" framework for outcomes as well.  Institutional choice is the result of a cost-benefit analysis between redist (where center/right always wants majoritarian to keep left out) and regulation/skills (where center/right may choose PR, if it's worth it).},

	to the larger population of registered voters in New Haven. In their
	conclusions, the authors compare their study to studies of other
	localities, without reference to differences or similarities across
	towns. It seems that the implied conclusion of the article is that
	the findings are applicable to all registered voters in the \emph{entire}
	United States. Since the original sample frame includes only voters
	in New Haven, a non-randomly selected town, the article's broadest
	implications appear to be over-reaching. The authors find that canvassing
	strongly increases turnout, mail weakly increases turnout, and phone
	calls do not affect turnout. Methodologically, the authors divide
	the treatment-minus-control effect estimate by the contact [compliance]
	rate to estimate causal effect. Two-stage OLS and two-stage probit
	estimates are employed, using assignment to contact as an instrument.},

Gormley describes political scientists as active in primarily non-experimental settings; my remarks below offer some of the contributions of political scientists to policy-experimental research, where the question of interest is often that on which policymakers are most focused: "what works?". First, political science understands the desire of politicians to tie the hands of future officeholders, and how to use evaluation output to do so in a scientifically rigorous way. Political scientists in field experiments are sensitive to the notion that it may be statisticaly desirable to exclude some units from consideration; specifically, those units that are not available to randomize because they are either certainly going to be treated in a policy experiment, or certainly not going to be treated. The concommitant description of a variety of statistical estimands has also been explored by political scientists. Relatedly, units may be lost during an experiment due to unknown factors which are discovered only after a policy experiment is underway, or due to intervening politics. Political scientists have described ex ante solutions to these dangers. Political scientists have translated these solutions into practical advice for experimenters, such as ``randomize at the level one below that at which politicians care". Political scientists also ofer knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of federalism's special challenges. Finally, political psychologists can offer advice on effective political communication derived from laboratory and field experiments.},

He argues that those who have acquired distinctive value-added skills will seek policies to protect them; conversely, those protections will lead individuals and firms to make the investments to create those capacities. Workers with more general skills demand and win fewer protections, which again creates a self-perpetuating logic: The absence of the protection for investment in skills results in lower levels of skill investment. Using individual preferences as his primary unit of analysis, Iversen creates exciting new ways to link choices about skills to a larger dynamic of welfare and party politics, intended to account for national variation in skills and social protection of skills."

	Abstract = {Background and Purpose. One of the roles of rehabilitation professionals in the acute care setting is making recommendations for patients' discharge placement. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the decision-making process of physical therapists and occupational therapists when recommending discharge destination for patients following acute care hospitalization. Subjects. Participants were 7 physical therapists and 2 occupational therapists in an acute care rotation at a large academic medical center. Methods. A grounded-theory strategy was used. Three interviews were conducted and guided by questions about participants' approaches to discharge decision making. Information from the interview transcripts was used to define constructs. A model was generated to explain the relationships among the constructs. Results. Decision making regarding discharge recommendations was guided by 4 constructs: patients' functioning and disability, patients' wants and needs, patients' ability to participate in care, and patients' life context. Information was filtered through therapists' experiences and modified by the health care team's opinions and by health care regulations. Discussion and Conclusion. The decision making of the rehabilitation professionals studied in recommending discharge placements for their patients reflects consideration of patients as individuals and the environments in which they live. Information about patients is filtered through the experience of therapists and influenced by health care regulations and opinions of other health care professionals, the patients, and their associates. The findings might be used in teaching clinical decision making to clinicians and students as they learn to make discharge recommendations.

	One of us argues that the implementation of these benefits, especially
	in the South, helped widen the income and wealth gaps between whites
	and blacks and further marginalized many African Americans; the other
	considers them to have been a rare example of a relatively inclusive
	policy, one that fostered equal citizenship. Because we are both
	historical institutionalists and we both share interests in matters
	of social policy, equality, and race, these dissimilar accounts require
	explanation. This dialogue first considers methodological issues,
	explaining our decisions about which forms of data to use and to
	emphasize, and how we made sense of contradictory findings. It next
	discusses interpretive matters, examining the processes through which
	we sometimes reached different conclusions even when we confronted
	the same evidence. Finally, the exchange considers some implications
	of our findings, probing the lessons they convey both about policy

@article{palgre09,
	Abstract = {Deference and dissent strike a delicate balance in any polity. Insufficient
	deference to authority may incapacitate government, whereas too much
	may allow leaders to orchestrate mass violence. Although cross-national
	and cross-temporal variation in deference to authority and willingness
	to express dissent has long been studied in political science, rarely
	have scholars studied programs designed to change these aspects of
	political culture. This study, situated in post-genocide Rwanda,
	reports a qualitative and quantitative assessment of one such attempt,
	a radio program aimed at discouraging blind obedience and reliance
	on direction from authorities and promoting independent thought and
	collective action in problem solving. Over the course of one year,
	this radio program or a comparable program dealing with HIV was randomly
	presented to pairs of communities, including communities of genocide
	survivors, Twa people, and imprisoned g{\`E}nocidaires. Changes in individual
	attitudes, perceived community norms, and deliberative behaviors
	were assessed using closed-ended interviews, focus group discussions,
	role-play exercises, and unobtrusive measures of collective decision
	making. Although the radio program had little effect on many kinds
	of beliefs and attitudes, it had a substantial impact on listeners'
	willingness to express dissent and the ways they resolved communal
	problems.},

	Annote = {Rubin shows that linear regression and matching can reduce or increase
	(to an arbitrarily degree) the bias in causal estimates, depending
	on the relationship between the distributions of the covariate in
	the treatment and control groups. Regression without matching ($tau_1$
	and $tau_2$ here) perform worst. The conclusions are (1) in general
	both matched sampling and regression adjustment can be expected to
	reduce bias, (2) in some cases when the variance of the matching
	variable differs in the two populations both matching and regression
	adjustment can increase bias, (3) when the variance of the matching
	variable is the same in the two populations and the distributions
	of the matching variable are symmetric the usual covariance adjusted
	estimate based on random samples is almost unbiased, and (4) the

                  conduct of such a trial where the "Play the Winner
                  Rule" (PWR) is used to assign patients to the
                  different therapies. The implementation of the PWR
                  in a clinical trial tends to place more patients on
                  the better treatment. Both theoretical and numerical
                  investigations show that over a wide range of
                  situations this rule leads to near optimum results
