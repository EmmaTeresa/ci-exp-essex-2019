\section*{Course Description}

This course is an introduction to causal inference and experiments for the social sciences.  We will discuss the nature of causal research, how to design research to answer different types of causal questions, how to analyze experimental (and perhapts observational) data, how to implement analysis using the R statistical language, and how to interpret the results of causal analyses.  Specific topics will include potential outcomes, experiments, blocked designs, conjoint, list, and multiarm bandit survey experiments.  We will examine observational matching, sensitivity, instruments, discontinuities, synthetic controls, and other special topics as permitted and as student interest dictates.


\section*{Learning Objectives}

By the end of the course, you should be able to 

\begin{itemize}
\item Identify causal effects using the potential outcomes framework
\item Perform design-based inference for randomized experiments
\item Create and analyze variety of randomized designs, including for blocked, conjoint, list, and multiarm bandit experiments
%\item Identify appropriate designs for causal inference in observational data, implement them, and interpret them; these include matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and synthetic controls
%\item Assess the sensitivity of estimates to unmeasured confounders
\item Estimate mediation effects and assess their sensitivity
\end{itemize}

\section*{Learning Strategies}

\subsection*{Readings}

Readings should be completed before the course meeting under which they are listed below.  

The primary textbook for the course is 

\nobibliography*

\bibverse{gergre12}


\subsection*{Problem Sets}
The problem sets should be completed outside of class.  You may work with others currently taking the course on the problem sets, but every keystroke of your submission must be your own.  You may not copy code or answers from others, but you may develop your code with classmates.  You are responsible for understanding every line of code you submit.  Academic integrity is a core value of institutions of higher learning.
It is your responsibility to avoid and report plagiarism, cheating, and
dishonesty.  


\section*{Software}

The primary software for the course is R.  See \href{http://www.ryantmoore.org/files/class/introPolResearch/intro_R_short.pdf}{http://j.mp/2swvN0p}
for help getting started.
